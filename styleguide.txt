Style guide:
	Constants in all caps
	CamelCase or hackerCase, no underscores
	Always use braces on function definitions
	Opening and closing curly braces go on the next line
	Types should be specified ONLY when:
		Using new
		Using cast
		Declaring return types
		Declaring argument types
		Declaring member types
	Avoid anonymous structures
	If there are optional arguments to a function, you must specify all arguments up to the last one provided
	Don't use Dynamic
	Don't use Abstract
	Only use typedef to rename types
	Don't use @:generic
	Only use safe cast
	Don't use inline
